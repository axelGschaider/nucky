The mission statement of this project is and always will be "sync a folder of .vcf files with google contacts". No more and no less.

Basic principles, choice of defaults and benchmarks are:
* smooth interaction with [ppl](https://github.com/h2s/ppl) although this project is in no way limited to this.
* A strict pollicy of "if in doubt: leave it to the user". No smart guessing please. We're dealing with real live user data here.
